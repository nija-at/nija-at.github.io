    <h2>The Colombo Daze</h2>
    <span class="blog-date">Feb 17, 2022</span>
    <p>
      After spending almost 10 days in Kalpitiya, we came into the city of Colombo for a day. The city, having spent
      most of my life in one and to which I associate myself with, felt for the most part comfortable. The presence of
      good public transport and cheap ride shares was a welcome relief, to the more self-drive obsessed villages.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, one experience stood out.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, we were departing Colombo towards Unawatuna. It was around 5.30pm and we were in a train station
      packed with office workers on their evening commute. The place was bustling with people and trains going in and
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then and after we boarded the train that I noticed the zombie-like looks on all their faces. They were all
      exhausted from their day at work, in full sleeved white shirts and black trousers with their belongings in a
      typical back pack of an office worker. Even with a COVID mask donned, I could make out their blood shot eyes
      avoiding eye contact. Once onboard and seated, the exhaustion that they had been fighting off consumed them, and
      heads nodded off to the rhythms of a running train.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a stark contrast from my interactions with the people in Kalpitiya, where eye contacts were met with
      friendly smiles, and conversations were struck with gentle ease. The people of Kalpitiya worked hard and long, but
      they carried with them a light soul and a wide smile. They likely went to bed exhausted as well, but I dare
      speculate that they welcomed it into their bed, rather than fight with it for as long as was possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having been an office worker and commuter for over 10 years myself, I am sure I have had many, if not most, days 
      end with my soul crushed. Crushed souls are not happy, and having an unhappy end to a day of hard work is not
      rewarding.
    </p>
    <p>
      This evening has given me a fresh, outside perspective on “toxic energy” to stay away from. How I will apply this
      to my life remains to be seen…
