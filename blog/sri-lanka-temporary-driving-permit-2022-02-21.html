    <h2>Sri Lanka: Temporary driving permit</h2>
    <span class="blog-date">Feb 21, 2022</span>
    <p>
      Foreign visitors to Sri Lanka must get a temporary driving permit to rent and drive a car or motorcycle over 100cc.
      Motorcycle and car rental companies end up charging about US$40 to get one of these. However, the actual price of
      this at the Sri Lanka's Department of Motor Transport is 1000 LKR (a mere US$5) - a complete rip off.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is pretty much no information available online about this or on the DMT's website. This post is for the
      next person who would rather get this permit on their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shout out to globetrove.com whose
      <a href="https://www.globetrove.com/temporary-driving-permit-sri-lanka/">excellent article</a>
      on this topic from 2018 helped me get started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly, the only place that issues this is the main Department of Motor Traffic office in Werahera
      (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Department+of+Motor+Traffic+DMT+RMV/@6.8281207,79.9086794,17z/">Maps</a>).

      You will need your original passport, original driving license, photocopy of the identity page in your passport,
      photocopy of the page in your passport with the Sri Lankan visa and 1000 LKR in cash.
    </p>
    <p>
      The classes (car or motorcycle or both) on the temporary permit will be based on the classes in your original
      driving license. So you cannot get a motorcycle class on your permit if it's not already on your original driving
      license.
    </p>
    <p>
      The DMT office gets crowded later in the day, so I recommend going as early as 8am here to avoid long waits.
      You will need to head to "Building H" that handles driving licenses.
      <br/>
      When I went in, there was already a long queue outside this building, but these were locals getting their driving
      license. Head straight to the head of the queue and tell the official or security guard why you're here. 
      They will lead you into the building, get you a token and give you the counter number where you must now wait at.
      <br/>
      I was lucky enough to be the second in line at this special counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is when you experience government bureaucracy from colonial times at its best. Each counter will take your
      documents, scan them or provide more forms, and then send you off to another counter. You will bounce around
      about 4-6 times in various counters, and each time you will need to queue (thankfully not long).
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of this nearly 2 hour dance, I got my permit and was ready to roll on my motorcycle tour of Sri Lanka.
